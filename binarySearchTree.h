BinarySearchTree.h
=====================================================

A header defining a binary search tree class.

Nodes are appended by key. Any new node added to
the tree is compared against the key of the root:
left if lower than; right if greater than.

If no node exists where a node travels, it becomes
appended as the child node; else, the node's key
is compared against the next node in the branch
and the process repeats.
